Title: R package for parsing and manipulating edit rules
Type: Package
LazyLoad: yes
Author: Edwin de Jonge, Mark van der Loo
Description: Facilitates reading and manipulation of linear
    (in)equalities, converting them into matrix format (and vice versa)
    and checking if data are valid according to these rules. Sets of
    linear edits can be manipulated using Fourier-Motzkin elimination
    and variable substitution and solving error localization problems
    based on the generalized principle of Felligi and Holt.
